1. Time Complexity
Worst Case: O(V Ã— E)

V-1 Relaxation Passes: Each pass processes all E edges.

Negative Cycle Check: One additional pass (O(E)).

Best Case: Still O(V Ã— E) (no early termination).

Space Complexity: O(V) (for storing distances).

2. Key Points to Remember for Interviews
âœ… Works with Negative Weights (unlike Dijkstra).
âœ… Detects Negative Cycles (unlike Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall).
âœ… Slower than Dijkstra (Dijkstra is O(E + V log V) with a priority queue).

âš  Edge Cases to Handle:

Disconnected Graphs: Some nodes may remain INT_MAX.

Negative Cycles:

If reachable from source â†’ shortest paths are undefined (return -1).

If unreachable â†’ ignore and return distances.

Large Weights/Overflows: Use INT_MAX carefully to avoid integer overflow.

3. Optimizations (Mention in Interview)
ðŸ”¹ Early Termination: If no relaxation occurs in a pass â†’ stop early.
ðŸ”¹ SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm): A queue-based optimization (but worst-case remains O(VÃ—E)).

4. When to Use Bellman-Ford?
Negative weights present.

Need to detect negative cycles.

Dense graphs where Dijkstraâ€™s priority queue overhead is high.

5. Sample Interview Question
"Given a directed graph with possible negative weights, find the shortest path from node S to all other nodes or detect a negative cycle."
