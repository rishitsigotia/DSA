// This question is solved by DFS but it is more likely to be understood by math.
// As the code is very less line but logic is more important why we are returing n - groups


//Suppose There are n stones
 âœ… Key Insight:
// You cannot remove all stones from a connected component (i.e., a group of stones connected via row/column).

// In each such group, you must leave at least one stone behind â€” the last one that has no more connections to any other.

// So in each group:

// If you have x stones, you can remove x - 1 stones.

ðŸ§® Math Behind It:
// Letâ€™s say there are G1, G2, ..., Gk groups of stones with:

// x1, x2, ..., xk stones in them respectively.
// Total Stones = x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n
// Max Stones Removed = (x1 - 1) + (x2 - 1) + ... + (xk - 1)
//                    = (x1 + x2 + ... + xk) - k
//                    = n - k
// Where k is the number of connected groups.


ðŸ“Œ Analogy (for Intuition):
// Imagine stones as people standing in rows and columns. If a person is alone in their row and column, they can't be removed (no "friend" to swap with). But in any group, all but one can be removed â€” the last one has no one left to swap with.
